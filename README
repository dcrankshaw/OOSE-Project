This is the repository for OOSE group 7's Biblio project.

We're using Eclipse.  We promise.
We haven't commited the project because it includes absolute pathnames we don't want to deal with.

You can build the (interesting parts of the) project by running ./build.sh, and you can run it with ./run.sh.  You should build before you run.

If you just run the project, it will get a bunch of NULLPointerExceptions.  We know.
The absolute paths for our testing PDF files are hard coded into Biblio/src/edu/jhu/cs/oose/biblio/gui/tests/ImportDialogGUITest.java.  You should probably change them to match your environment.  This will get fixed, probably in the next Iteration.

Also, if you resize the winodw too much, then the program starts getting OutOfMemory errors.  We'll deal with them.
