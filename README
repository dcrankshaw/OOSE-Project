This is the repository for OOSE group 7's Biblio project.

Iteration 4:
The Eclipse project is in the Biblio Directory.

The following parts can be run:
The classes in edu.jhu.cs.oose.biblio.model.tests can be run as JUnit tests.
The class edu.jhu.cs.oose.biblio.gui.MainWindow can be run as a Java Application
The classes in edu.jhu.cs.oose.biblio.gui.tests can be run as Java Applications

Iteration 3:
We're using Eclipse.  We promise.
We haven't commited the project because it includes absolute pathnames we don't want to deal with.

You can build the (interesting parts of the) project by running ./build.sh, and you can run it with ./run.sh.  You should build before you run.

If you just run the project, it will get a bunch of NULLPointerExceptions.  We know.
The absolute paths for our testing PDF files are hard coded into Biblio/src/edu/jhu/cs/oose/biblio/gui/tests/ImportDialogGUITest.java.  You should probably change them to match your environment.  This will get fixed, probably in the next Iteration.

Also, if you resize the winodw too much, then the program starts getting OutOfMemory errors.  We'll deal with them.
