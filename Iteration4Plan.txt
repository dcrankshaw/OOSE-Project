In this iteration we accomplished the bulk of our goals. We have a database up and working, with it passing
all of the unit tests written for it. We are using Hibernate with HSQLDB as our database solution. We have almost
completed the GUI, with only a couple small components still needing to be written. In addition, we have implemented
full text searching of PDF files, and searching for tags in the database based on a string search term. Both
of these search methods have unit tests written for them that they pass. Although we didn't get quite as far with
the GUI being connected to the model as we had hoped, we got much farther with the full-text searching than
we expected. This turned out to be relatively easy to do, and so we hope to eventually implement some sort of
highlighting of full-text search results.

For the next iteration, we will have the full program working, with basic importing, tagging (and tag editing),
 and reading all possible from the GUI. We will also write the method to filter by tags, which has relatively
complicated functionality and cannot be expressed with a simple database query. We will have begun to implement
RSS feed reading, but without the expectation that this will be fully completed by Iteration 5. We will also
allow for bookmarking of files and adding tags to categories.

By iteration 6, the full program will be functional, and the GUI will be nicely polished. RSS reading and
automatic importing and tagging will be implemented. We plan to add support for the epub format as well, which is
an open source xhtml based layout format. We will also add some support to remember sessions across application
closing (so that we can e.g. reopen the last tabs that were open). We will also add support for adding notes to
files and bookmarks.
