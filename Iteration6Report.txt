For this iteration, we added support for the epub format and directory watching.  Epubs work just like PDF files; they can be tagged, searched, and viewed.  The model implementation needed to manipulate Bookmarks was implemented, though the GUI elements were not finished yet (there is no way to create or modify them), so they are not visible.

During Iteration 6, we ran into signficant difficulty integrating all of the parts of our application.  This required adding interfaces such as Tagable and the associated TagListener to update different parts of the GUI to changes in the model.  We added the Database class, a layer on top of Hibernate, in order to ensure that there was only one copy of each item from Hibernate.

In a hypothetical next iteration, we would finish the GUI support for Bookmarks, and make the program more robust.  We would like to implement subscriptions to RSS feeds; this would require modifications to both the model and the GUI.  Autocompletion of Tags would be a very useful, though not blockbuster, feature to add to the TagsListsPanes to help the user re-use tags.  Though we find our user interface intuitive and easy to use, future work would include detailed, perhaps interactive, tutorials explaining how to use Biblio.
