In this iteration we added and cleaned up several things. We added support for filtering files by tags (for an explanation of this process see the README). We added support for searching for all tags matching a keyword within a given Tag category. We added several more unit tests, especially for searching functionality (in SearchManagerTest.java), all which pass right now. We also added a lot of GUI support, including the Tag Editor, and making the search panel show a list of the currently selected tags, even if those tags do not match current tag search results. This allows the user to build up set of tags  to use for filtering by searching for each one by name instead of having to look for each one in a long list.

In the next (and last) iteration, we will add the following features. We will finish support for the epub format. We will allow the user to add directories to be watched automatically, so that if a file in a format Biblio supports is added to that directory, we will automatically prompt the user to import it into Biblio. We will use the Watch Service API in the java.nio.file package (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/notification.html) for this functionality. We will add support for automatically importing RSS feeds with a given tag. And if there is time, we will save state when the user closes the application, reopening the application to the files last open.
