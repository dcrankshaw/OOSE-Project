- directory watching
	- allow user to select directory to watch (from file menu)
- finish importing
- epub support
- rss reading
- note taking?
- bookmarking
- load rest of pdf in separate thread
- tags with pdf and epub metadata - should be pretty easy to do
- move search from PDFFileMetadata to PDFFileContents
- add highlighting to selected items (especially in importing)
	- get rid of the "selected" button
- case insensitive search
- visitor pattern for factories
- unit tests
- actually copy files into a repository
- DatabaseTests fails with Hibernate errors (exciting!)
	- Update DatabaseTests to use our DB interface
- Take a look at searchBookmark
- Put the regular SQL queries through the database class (Paul just moved the Criteria queries)
- Remove files from our library ( I can't imagine a use case for this!)
- Searching on the side of the FullFileView (just add a search panel to the left and we also need to implement SearchResultsListPanel)
